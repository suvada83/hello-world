# hello-world
My name is Suvada Arnautovic. I live and work in New Hampshire, US. I study at SNHU and will be graduating
with BS in Information Technology. During my IT major at SNHU I took a JAVA introduction class and liked
the coding very much. I am here to test my ability to learn the code hoping that it will work out and
eventually help me get a job in Web Development.
